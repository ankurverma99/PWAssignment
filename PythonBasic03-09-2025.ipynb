    "1. What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n",
    "Ans>   Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.\n",
    "   Versatility: Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, scientific computing, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to Learn and Read: Python emphasizes readability and simplicity, making it an excellent choice for beginners. Its clean syntax reduces the cost of program maintenance and development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation and Compilation: Python is an interpreted language, which means code is executed line by line, making it easier to debug and test. However, Python can also be compiled into bytecode for improved performance using tools like PyInstaller, Cython, or Nuitka.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Typing: Python uses dynamic typing, meaning you don't need to declare variable types explicitly. This flexibility allows for rapid development and prototyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Community Support: Python has a vast and active community of developers who contribute to its ecosystem by creating libraries, frameworks, and tools. This community support makes it easy to find solutions to problems, learn new techniques, and collaborate on projects."
